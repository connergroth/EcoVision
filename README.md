# EcoVision: Smart Recycling Detection App
## Project for the [AMD AI Track](https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie) at HackCU11 

EcoVision is an intelligent recycling assistant that uses computer vision and AI to help users identify recyclable items, learn proper disposal methods, and track their environmental impact.

## AMD AI PC Implementation
EcoVision leverages AMD Ryzen™ AI PC technology to optimize our object detection pipeline. We've specifically engineered our YOLOv8 model to utilize the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) on AMD hardware, which provides significant performance improvements while reducing power consumption. This implementation enables real-time recyclable item detection directly on-device with minimal latency, making the app more responsive and energy-efficient for everyday use.

## Problem Statement

Improper waste disposal and low recycling rates remain significant environmental challenges:
- Many people are unsure about which items can be recycled
- Recycling rules vary by location and can be confusing
- Lack of immediate feedback makes it difficult to build good recycling habits
- Limited knowledge about the environmental impact of individual actions

EcoVision addresses these challenges by providing real-time identification, personalized guidance, and gamification elements to make recycling more accessible and engaging.
